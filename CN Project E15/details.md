Mini Project for Computer Network Lab


<h2> Reverse Shell </h2>

Brief about the project

Reverse shell is a way to connect to anyone's personal computer anywhere in the world. It uses the concept of reverse connection in the basics of the networking section of direct and reverse connection.

Let's say you are in India and your friend is sitting in Texas and he wants some help with his computer. So you can just connect to his PC using a reverse shell and fix the problems. That's one of the uses of a reverse shell.

Another popular use of a reverse shell, though not very ethical, is for hackers who want to gain access to someone's PC without his knowledge. What they do is that they spread this program around by giving free CD's or pen-drives in front of Walmart or something and you pop in the pen-drive thinking hey I wonder what's in this. And boom they now have access to your computer.
